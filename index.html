<a name="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h4>

<p>Welcome to TadsPad, an open-source IDE designed for the development
of TADS3/adv3Lite Interactive Fiction. If you're reading this, you're
likely eager to get to writing your own games. For the most part, if
you can use any modern word processor, you can probably use TadsPad to
make a TADS story with minimum duress.</p>

<p>The Quick Start section is designed to get you into programming with
TadsPad right away, and is probably no more than most users will need.</p>

<p>Why build another IDE for TADS? First, while TADS Workbench is an
excellent piece of software, it is MS-Windows only. Furthermore, there were a number of 
features I missed from other development packages, like code completion,
spell checking, context help and editor themes. I also wanted tight integration to
Eric Eve's fantastic adv3Lite, along with built-in TADS object browsing.
And anyway, I wanted to write games on my Linux laptop, so TadsPad was
to be implented in cross-platform Python 2.7.</p>

<p>What is not included in TadsPad? Most notably, Workbench users
will note the lack of the debugger. I have no plans at the present time
to add a debugger to this software, as the complicated plumbing required
to do so would be an enormous job, and the current *nix TADS 
interpreters would need to be rewritten.</p>

<p>Requirements:
<br>Python 2.7
<br>wxPython 2.8 or higher
<br>TADS 3.1 or higher (compiler <i>and</i> interpreter)
<br>adv3Lite
<br>A decently fast computer</p>

<p>Quick point about decently fast computers: TadsPad does some heavy
calculations in the background for the code completion subsystem. Nearly
all processors in use can handle the load, but it's worth bearing in
mind. That said, I wrote a whole game on a 12-year-old Pentium III with
Crunchbang Linux, and TadsPad held up fine.</p>

<p>wxPython is the required GUI toolkit. It is a mature and popular
cross-platform widget kit, and has been used in other, similiar 
applications with success. In testing, however, I found that most Linux
repo's contained old versions of wxPython. TadsPad will try to use
whatever is installed, but some features will not work on anything under
version 3.0, like correct coloring on triple quotes or brace 
highlighting. </p>

<p>TadsPad requires that adv3Lite is correctly installed in your user's
Documents/TADS 3/extensions directory. If TadsPad cannot find adv3Lite,
it will exit.</p>

<p><br><br></p><h4>
<a name="quick-start" class="anchor" href="#quick-start"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Quick Start</h4>

<p>Assuming that all dependancies are met, TadsPad will load and show
a Tip of the Day, like this:</p>

<p><img src="images/tip.png"></p>

<p>Click "Create New Project" to begin a new story. The New Project
window will open, looking like this:</p>

<p><img src="images/newproject.png"></p>

<p>It may look a bit overwhelming, but creating a new project is 
actually very simple. The only required field on this window is the 
Project Name; everything else can be edited after the project is 
created, even the game title and description.</p>

<p>Go ahead and enter a project name. Note that the project name is not
the same as the game title: the name is the literal filename the
TADS compiler will generate when the story is built into a single
TADS VM file. Hence, the project name should only contain alphanumeric
characters, as punctuation marks or symbols will produce an invalid
filename.</p>

<p>You can now fill the other fields as you like. Note the game title,
author, email, html description and text description can all be changed
by editing the versionInfo object contained in start.t, which will be
generated after the project is created.</p>

<p>Below the email field you'll see you have the ability to choose the
library you want to compile your project with. By default, the adv3Lite
library is selected. You can also choose the adv3Liter library, which
creates a streamlined world model suitable for simpler games (like those
containing no actors or dialogue, for instance.)</p>

<p>Still further below is the option to build your own custom library.
By default, all the standard adv3Lite files are included in the custom
library setup, but you can include or exclude any combination of
files or extensions you like. TadsPad searches the extensions path for
new extensions on load, so if you've got a super cool new extension
you've just downloaded (or built yourself) TadsPad can incorporate it
and it will be built into the code completion database.</p>

<p>Caution: if you choose to build a custom library, not all 
combinations of source files will produce a working game. It is
recommended that unless you know what you're doing, that you include
all the default adv3Lite source files. For instance, the extension
roomparts.t will NOT work without standard adv3Lite file extras.t.</p>

<p>If this is your first new project, you may choose to just go with
the standard adv3Lite library, which is selected by default.</p>

<p>On the right side of the window you'll note the game description
text boxes, one for html and one for straight Unicode text. It is
recommended that you write the html version first. While you're typing,
TadsPad will fill the standard text box with the text from the html
box, save for whatever html tags and special tokens you may have used.</p>

<p>For instance, if you have typed:</p>

<p><code></code></p>

<p>This is my new project &amp;mdash; made with TadsPad.</p>

<p></p>

<p><br><br>within the html box, in the text box it will appear as:<br><br></p>

<p><code></code></p>

<p>This is my new project made with TadsPad.</p>

<p></p>

<p><br><br>because the special html token &amp;mdash; is removed.<br><br></p>

<p>For this User's Guide, I made a filled the entry fields like so:</p>

<p><img src="images/newproject2.png"></p>

<p>With all of your name project fields set to your liking, go ahead and
click "Ok" to create your new project. TadsPad will now take a moment to
scan your adv3Lite source files. This step is necessary as each library
setup can be different — for instance, if you chose to use 
adv3Liter, it will produce a different set of source files to scan as
opposed to the default adv3Lite. Primarily, this is so TadsPad can build
the code completion database. While building library references, TadsPad
will display a window that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="images/building.png"></p>

<p>When the library references are built, TadsPad will finally appear 
onscreen:</p>

<p><img src="images/gettingstarted.png"></p>

<p>TadsPad will automatically create a directory for your project in the
Documents/TADS 3 path. Presently, the project contains only a very
simple single code file (start.t) and the project file used for 
compilation. As is, this project will compile successfully into an 
extremely simple game. You can play it by selecting Tools-&gt;Compile and
Debug from the menu toolbar, or pressing the shortcut key F5.</p>

<p>Let's demonstrate how code completion works in TadsPad. Type the
following code into the start.t file, on line 55 (at the end of the 
file): </p>

<p><code></code></p>

<p>++ lamp: Thing ''</p>

<p></p>

<p>Note that if you copy and paste the code above instead of typing it,
you will not see the code completion engine work. As you type the
keyword “Thing” TadsPad will suggest TAction then
Thing as you type letter T then H. As you press the Enter key when
you are done typing, TadsPad will automatically add a semicolon below
your caret and indent, as it recognizes that you're creating a new
object.</p>

<p>You might have noticed that there's nothing yet within the single
quotes. There's not much use to a Thing object with no vocab 
property set, so let's put the following text between the quotes on line
55:</p>

<p><code></code></p>

<p>brass lantern;old rusty;lamp</p>

<p></p>

<p>Were this a real game, we'd probably make this object much more
sophisticated, but this suits the purposes of a tutorial. While entering
text between two single quotes or two double quotes, TadsPad is smart
enough not to give suggestions from the code completion engine.</p>

<p>Press Ctrl+S to Save All unsaved files in this project. You can also
Save All by selecting File-&gt;Save All from the menu toolbar. Each time
the project is saved, TadsPad will re-scan for objects within your 
source code. On the right side of the screen in the Object Browser in 
the Project View control you should now see your new object, 
“lamp” along with the file it's in and the line number of the
object.</p>

<p><img src="images/projectview.png"></p>

<p>Press F5 and your test game will compile and run. You'll now see
the brass lantern within your inventory while the game is running. </p>

<p>Returning to TadsPad, let's take a moment to check out the Context
Help system. Using either the arrow keys or mouse cursor, position
the caret over the word “Thing” on line 55; then, press the
F1 key. On the bottom of the screen, the Context Help control should
now look like this:</p>

<p><img src="images/contexthelp.png"></p>

<p>The Context Help text field will fill with the adv3Lite documention
for the keyword the caret is on top of, in this case, Thing. For a more
complicated example, move the caret to line 56, so we're now editing the
lamp object.</p>

<p>Type the letters i, s, and m while the caret is editing lamp. You'll
see that TadsPad suggests the property isMoveable. Go ahead and select
isMoveable, and press F1. Now, the Context Help text reflects the
help text for the isMoveable property of class Thing. Note that the
help text is gathered from comments in adv3Lite's source code, not
from the documentation text.</p>

<p>You might now choose to delete line 56, containing the isMoveable
property, as we're finished with Context Help for now.</p>

<p>Of course, the Context Help is no substitute for an actual library
reference, which most authors choose to have in the background while 
writing TADS code. Press F2 or select Help-&gt;Adv3Lite Bookshelf to access
the complete adv3Lite documentation in your web browser. Note that most
operating systems will not require that you have a web browser already opened
before pressing F2.</p>

<p>After your game becomes fairly large, it becomes cumbersome to have
to navigate the complete story geography or re-type the commands necessary
to reach a certain point in the game you'd like to debug. This is where
Transcript View Window is useful.</p>

<p>To demonstrate, press F5 to run your game again, and then type any
sequence of commands you like. In this example, I entered: </p>

<p><code></code></p>

<p>jump</p>

<p>yell</p>

<p>examine me</p>

<p>attack</p>

<p>drop the lantern</p>

<p>q</p>

<p>y</p>

<p></p>

<p>The last two commands (q and y) exited the TADS interpreter. Having
returned to TadsPad, press F6 or select Tools-&gt;View Transcript from
the menu toolbar to open the Transcript View Window.</p>

<p><img src="images/transcript.png"></p>

<p>A complete set of commands entered in the last session on your game
(including commands that didn't work in-game) are displayed onscreen. If you
want to save a transcript for later, press the Save Transcript button
to store those commands to file on disk. If you double-click one of the
commands, the game will run and automatically enter all commands up through
the one you've selected, bringing you to a certain point in the game. For
instance, if you double-click the command “drop the lantern”
you'll find the game runs and the in-game world now has the lantern on
the ground instead of in the player's inventory.</p>

<p><img src="images/layout.png"><br><br></p>

<p><b>The Object Browser</b></p>

<p>On the right side of the screen on the standard TadsPad Window is
the object browser. Every time you save the project, TadsPad will
refresh the browser with all the objects in the project. If you'd like
to go straight to a specfic object, double-click it in the object browser,
and TadsPad will open the file with the object and display it in the
editor.</p>

<p><b>Project Files</b></p>

<p>TadsPad maintains a complete list of the .t source files in your
project. To view any one of them, double-click the file and you'll see it
loaded in the editor.</p>

<p><b>Message Center</b></p>

<p>The Message Center is TadsPad's primary way of communicating with you,
the author. If you use the Context Help (by putting the caret over a
valid adv3Lite keyword and pressing F1) the Message Center will automatically
select the Context Help tab and display the keyword help.</p>

<p>You can manually switch between the Compile Output and the Context Help
and any time, by selecting them with the tabs on the bottom of the screen.
The Compile Output is displayed automatically on game compile, to display
messages from the TADS compiler. If there are any build errors, you can
double-click the error in the Compile Output and view the offending
line of code in the editor.</p>

<p><b>The Editor</b></p>

<p>If you've ever used Notepad, or most any other text editor, the editor
component of TadsPad will seem very familiar. TadsPad harnesses the wxPython
packged version of the venerable Scintilla, used also by TADS Workbench.
As such, TadsPad will automatically syntax highlight TADS code for the
convenience of the author.</p>

<p><br><br></p><h4>
<a name="advanced-features" class="anchor" href="#advanced-features"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Advanced Features</h4>

<p><b>Spell Checking</b></p>

<p>If you happen to have an internet connection, TadsPad can use
After the Deadline, a free spelling/grammer check web service, to scan
your game for spelling mistakes. TadsPad will automatically extract all
the strings in the opened tab in the editor and ship them off to AtD.</p>

<p>To use the Spell Check, press F7, or select Tools-&gt;Spell Check from
the menu toolbar. If no errors remain, or AtD is down for some reason, no
spell check window will appear. Otherwise, TadsPad will give you a choice
of what you'd like to do with the given spelling error.</p>

<p><b>Reconfigure Library</b></p>

<p>In the event that you'd like to change what library sources your project
uses, you can do that at any time by selecting Tools-&gt;Reconfigure Library
from the menu toolbar.</p>

<p><img src="images/reconfigure.png"></p>

<p>For instance, let's say you made a project with adv3Liter, and decided
while working on the project that you really need the full adv3Lite. Open
the Reconfigure Library Window and select adv3Lite (which is the default.)
Click Ok and TadsPad will rebuild the library references. Note that the
code completion database and the context help will rebuild as well.</p>

<p><b>Text Settings</b></p>

<p><img src="images/textsettings.png"></p>

<p>You can change the text size and color theme at any time by selecting
Edit-&gt;Text Settings from the menu toolbar. To make the font larger, slide
the size control to the right, or to the left for smaller text. </p>

<p>TadsPad will understand (most) standard XML Eclipse themes. TadsPad
comes with a few, but you can download hundreds more from the internet.
To change the theme, click Load Color Scheme on the Text Settings Window. A 
file selection dialog box will appear, and you can choose a new
scheme. </p>

<p><b>Executable Paths</b></p>

<p>TadsPad needs to know where TADS 3 is installed for the purpose of
compiling and running games. On *nix platforms, TadsPad will also need
to know where to find a Terminal Emulator, like xterm. On first time
load, TadsPad will make guesses as to where each of those pathes exist
on the local system. If TadsPad is incorrect — like, for example,
if you've got TADS installed in some really weird place — you can 
change the path and file where TadsPad will look.</p>

<p><img src="images/executablepaths.png"></p>

<p>Select Edit-&gt;Executable Path from the menu toolbar. From here, you can
change the TADS compiler, the TADS interpreter, or the Terminal Emulator.
Note that on Windows systems the Terminal Emulator path is not used.</p>

<p>Caution: the Terminal Emulator you choose must use xterm style command
executable switches, lest TadsPad crash whenever you try to compile and run
and game.</p>

<p>Furthermore, on the *nix platforms, you MUST use frobtads (executable
name is frob, which is the default) as QTads will not import transcripts.</p>
