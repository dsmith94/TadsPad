decorationActions
The base Decoration class includes GoTo as a decorationAction. For a Distant object (e.g. the sun or moon or a distanct mountain) this will often be inappropriate. Where an object is 'locally distant' as it were, i.e. a sign mounted high up on a wall, you may want to override decorationActions to include GoTo, since GO TO SIGN would then be a reasonable way for the player to get to the location of the sign.
